            <p>Parasite (2019) which was directed by Bong Joon Ho, revolves around a poor family of parents, son, and daughter, who struggle to survive in a society with the least luxuries. They were managing their lives, obviously criticizing the wealthy, until one day Choi-woo-sik, the son of the family received an opportunity to tutor a wealthy girl, through a friend’s invitation.  This is when the whole comedy turns into a tragedy, for the time being, because of the human desire for luxury and the prevailing avarice for pampered commodities.</p>

            <p>In Perfect Blue, winsome and innocent singer Mima (voiced by Junko Iwao) gives up her pop idol status by leaving the bouncy pop group CHAM! to strike out on her own as a "serious actress." But this career change upsets some of Mima's more obsessive fans. Meanwhile, after being shown a fan-made website for her, complete with daily blog entries and self-styled journal commentary, Mima receives threatening messages. And when people start getting murdered all around her, a bewildered Mima begins to wonder who she really is: a character she portrays on television, or the former pop star she used to be.</p>
