# Movie Review Website: Screen Spotlight  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains a **movie review website** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The site showcases a curated selection of top-rated films, upcoming releases, and a team of dedicated film critics. This project was developed in my Front End Development 1 course as our first project exploring using JavaScript and interactive HTML pages.

**Key Features:**  
- **Curated Movie Reviews** – Detailed reviews of top-rated films.  
- **Upcoming Movie Highlights** – Sneak peeks into upcoming releases.  
- **Embedded Video Trailers** – Watch movie trailers directly on the site.  
- **Team Section** – Meet the expert film critics behind the reviews.
